# Cryptopals

Solutions to the cryptography challenges found @ https://cryptopals.com This is a work in progress and will eventually contain my solutions to all the cryptopals challenges. I'm doing this to learn more about cryptography and improve my knowledge of Python.

All solutions in Python 3.

Description

The Cryptopals Crypto challenges are 64 exercises divided into 8 sets. As the Cryptopals website states, " They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked."
